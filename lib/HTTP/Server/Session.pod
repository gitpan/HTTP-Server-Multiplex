=head1 NAME

HTTP::Server::Session - one user at client-side

=head1 INHERITANCE

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Each session object administers the activities of one user.  A session
may be used for multiple connections at the same time.  A session will
survive connection breaking without loss of information.

In the moment, a session is nothing else than an empty HASH.  Hopefully
soon, some useful general purpose logic will get added.
